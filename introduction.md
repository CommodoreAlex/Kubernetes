# Introduction to Kubernetes

This section will introduce you to Kubernetes, its core concepts, and why it has become an essential tool for modern application development and deployment.

## What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes, often abbreviated as **K8s**, is an open-source container orchestration platform. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications, making it easier to manage complex systems reliably and efficiently.

## Why Learn Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is widely adopted in the tech industry, and here are some reasons why it’s worth learning:

1. **Scalability**: Automatically scale your applications based on demand.
2. **Portability**: Run your workloads consistently across different environments (local, cloud, hybrid).
3. **Resilience**: Self-healing capabilities ensure high availability by restarting failed containers and rescheduling them as needed.
4. **Automation**: Simplify deployments, updates, and rollbacks.

## Core Concepts
Before diving into Kubernetes, here are some foundational concepts to understand:

- **Cluster**: A collection of machines (nodes) that run Kubernetes-managed applications.
- **Node**: A single machine in the cluster, which can be a virtual or physical machine.
- **Pod**: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, typically representing one or more containers.
- **Service**: An abstraction that exposes a group of pods to external traffic or other internal services.
- **Deployment**: A higher-level abstraction to manage pods, ensuring the desired state of your application.

## Use Cases
Kubernetes is versatile and can be used for a wide range of applications:

- **Microservices architecture**: Simplify deployment and scaling of microservices.
- **Batch processing**: Run large-scale batch or data processing jobs.
- **CI/CD pipelines**: Automate testing and deployment workflows.
- **Hybrid cloud setups**: Create consistent environments across cloud and on-premises setups.

## Prerequisites
Before you start using Kubernetes, make sure you:

- Have a basic understanding of containers (e.g., Docker).
- Familiarize yourself with the command line.
- Install tools like `kubectl` and optionally a local cluster tool like Minikube (covered in [Setup Instructions](setup-instructions.md)).
