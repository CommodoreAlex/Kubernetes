## Introduction
This guide introduces Kubernetes, a powerful container orchestration platform, covering everything from setting up your Kubernetes environment to managing and scaling applications.

## Setup Instructions
Follow the instructions in the repository to install and configure the necessary tools like `kubectl` and Minikube, which will help you run Kubernetes on your local machine.

## Kubernetes Architecture 
Learn about the core components of Kubernetes, such as nodes, pods, services, and deployments, and how they work together to run and manage containerized applications.

## Basic kubectl Commands 
Get familiar with `kubectl`, the command-line tool used to interact with Kubernetes clusters. This section will help you master basic commands for managing resources.

## Creating a Simple Application
Follow the steps to create and deploy a simple application in Kubernetes, including creating deployments and exposing services.

## Scaling Applications
Learn how to scale your applications up or down, ensuring the right number of instances to handle traffic.

## Networking & Storage
Understand how Kubernetes manages networking between pods, services, and external systems, as well as how it handles persistent storage.

## Troubleshooting 
Troubleshoot common Kubernetes issues and learn useful debugging commands.

## Security
Understand the basics of securing a Kubernetes cluster, including best practices for authentication, authorization, and network policies.

## Helm
Learn the basics of Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes. Helm simplifies the deployment and management of applications on Kubernetes by using pre-configured packages called charts. This section covers the core concepts of Helm, including how to install Helm, use charts from repositories, and manage Helm releases for your Kubernetes applications. Helm allows you to easily deploy, upgrade, and maintain complex applications on Kubernetes with simple commands and configuration files.
